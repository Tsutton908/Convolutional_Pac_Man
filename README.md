# Convolutional Deep Learning Pac-Man Nueral Network

This project is a personal introduction to convolutional neural networks. In this case, using the Gymnasium library and pytorch; this nueral network is trained for approximatly 2 hrs and over an average of 1000 iterations. 
Note that goal for the pac man agent is set relatively low at 800 points for a single game, this is done for convience of training and not overrun the training period.

# Example of Neural Network Playing Pac Man after single training period.
This agent was trained on the T4 GPU Google Copilot model. With the overall average reward set to 500 points, total allowed episodes at 2000, and an epsilon decay of 0.99.
The agent completed the task in approximately  episodes with an ending point total of .

Here are the avargae for every 100 episodes of the trained agent:
Episode 100	Average Score: 300.00
Episode 200	Average Score: 353.40
Episode 300	Average Score: 455.70
Episode 400	Average Score: 485.00
Episode 500	Average Score: 370.30
Episode 600	Average Score: 424.80
Episode 700	Average Score: 391.00
Episode 800	Average Score: 476.00
Episode 867	Average Score: 505.90
